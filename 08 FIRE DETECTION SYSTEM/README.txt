As we all know, architecture represents the accomplishment, wealth, and creativity of a city or a nation. No one wants to afford damage to them. Fire accident is one of the major cause which harms not only buildings but also human beings.The most usual causes of house fires are electrical distribution, lighting systems, cooking, Etc. In this technological era, the use of engineering is the best way to avoid such accidents. Today, we will learn about an interesting project using Arduino for safety purposes using a flame sensor.

Supplies:
The components required to build this project are mentioned below.

Arduino Uno

Flame Sensor

Step 1: ​What Is Flame Sensor?
The flame sensor detects the presence of fire or flame. It uses the infrared flame flash technique for working.

This explicit flame detector is consists of a Photo Transistor. It is often located at the front of the module in the form of a black LED. As a flame detection system works within the infrared spectral band, it ranges between 4.3 to 4.4 micrometers. This range covers the resonance frequency of Carbon Dioxide, which is generated by the burning of organic compound materials.Greenhouse gases generated from the fire create radiation emission and special patterns in infrared emission. A flame sensor detects both of them. It is faster as well accurate than a fire or smoke detector. If you are still reading this, it means you are surely interested in its interfacing with Arduino. So, let’s move forward with its working.
